# DSA Music Player

DSA Music Player is a feature-rich, efficient music player application designed to demonstrate the implementation of various data structures and algorithms. The project showcases how fundamental concepts in computer science can be applied to solve real-world problems in music management and playback.

## Features

- **Playlist Management**: Create, edit, and delete playlists. Efficiently manage large collections of songs using data structures like linked lists, hash tables, and trees.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find songs, artists, or albums with advanced search algorithms.
- **Sorting**: Sort playlists by different criteria such as song title, artist name, or album using various sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort).
- **Queue System**: Implement a queue to manage song playback order, supporting standard operations like enqueue, dequeue, and peek.
- **Playback Controls**: Basic controls for play, pause, stop, next, and previous, demonstrating state management and control flow.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface built with a modern GUI framework.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load playlists and settings using file I/O and serialization techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, hash tables, binary search trees, queues
- **Algorithms**: Search algorithms, sorting algorithms
- **GUI Framework**: Qt or another suitable C++ GUI framework
- **Development Tools**: CMake, Git
